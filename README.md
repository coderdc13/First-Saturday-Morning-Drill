Greetings. My name is Franklin Bueno. In terms of background, I am coming from academia, specifically research in medical science. My career goals are focused on FINTECH, and I am loving being in this awesome class!!! I didn't choose FINTECH, it's more accurate to state that FINTECH just took over the world for better or for worse.
